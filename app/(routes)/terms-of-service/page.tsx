If this is not reasonably possible, it will be indicated before the distance contract is concluded that the general terms and conditions can be viewed at the entrepreneur and that they will be sent free of charge as soon as possible at the consumer&apos;s request.
                
                If the distance contract is concluded electronically, in deviation from the previous paragraph and before the distance contract is concluded, the text of these general terms and conditions can be made available to the consumer electronically in such a way that they can be easily stored by the consumer on a durable data carrier. If this is not reasonably possible, it will be indicated before the distance contract is concluded where the general terms and conditions can be viewed electronically and that they will be sent free of charge electronically or otherwise at the consumer&apos;s request.
                
                In the event that specific product or service conditions apply in addition to these general terms and conditions, the second and third paragraphs apply accordingly and the consumer can always rely on the applicable provision that is most favourable to him in the event of conflicting general terms and conditions.

The description is sufficiently detailed to enable the consumer to properly assess the offer. If the entrepreneur uses images, these are a true representation of the products and/or services offered. Obvious mistakes or obvious errors in the offer do not bind the entrepreneur.
                
                All images, specifications and data in the offer are indicative and cannot give rise to compensation or termination of the agreement.
                
                Images of products are a true representation of the products offered. The entrepreneur cannot guarantee that the colours displayed correspond exactly to the real colours of the products.
                
                Each offer contains such information that it is clear to the consumer what the rights and obligations are that are associated with accepting the offer. This concerns in particular:

                If the consumer has accepted the offer electronically, the entrepreneur will immediately confirm receipt of acceptance of the offer electronically. As long as the agreement of this acceptance has not been confirmed by the entrepreneur, the consumer can terminate the agreement.
                
                If the agreement is concluded electronically, the entrepreneur will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure the electronic transfer of data and will ensure a secure web environment. If the consumer can pay electronically, the entrepreneur will observe appropriate security measures for this purpose.
                
                The entrepreneur can - within legal frameworks - inform himself whether the consumer can meet his payment obligations, as well as all those facts and factors that are important for a responsible conclusion of the distance contract. If the entrepreneur has good reasons not to enter into the agreement based on this investigation, he is entitled to refuse an order or request with reasons or to attach special conditions to the execution.
                
                The entrepreneur will send the following information to the consumer with the product or service, in writing or in such a way that the consumer can store it in an accessible manner on a durable data carrier:

This cooling-off period commences on the day after receipt of the product by the consumer or a representative designated in advance by the consumer and made known to the entrepreneur.
                
                During the cooling-off period, the consumer will handle the product and packaging with care. He will only unpack or use the product to the extent necessary to assess whether he wishes to keep the product. If he exercises his right of withdrawal, he will return the product with all accessories supplied and - if reasonably possible - in the original condition and packaging to the entrepreneur, in accordance with the reasonable and clear instructions provided by the entrepreneur.

                If the customer has not indicated that he wishes to exercise his right of withdrawal after the expiry of the periods mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 or has not returned the product to the entrepreneur, the purchase is a fact.
                
                In the case of delivery of services:
                
                In the case of delivery of services, the consumer has the option to dissolve the agreement without giving reasons for at least 14 days, starting on the day the agreement was concluded.

                The costs of return are for the account of the consumer. The consumer has 30 days to indicate that he wants to make use of his right of withdrawal. If the customer has not indicated that he wants to make use of his right of withdrawal after these 30 days, or has not returned the product to the entrepreneur, the purchase is a fact.
                
                In the event of damage to the product due to careless handling by the consumer himself, the consumer is liable for any reduction in value of the product.
                
                The consumer cannot be held liable for reduction in value of the product if the entrepreneur has not provided all legally required information about the right of withdrawal. This information must be provided before the purchase agreement is concluded.

                at least terminate in the same manner as they were entered into by him;
                
                always terminate with the same notice period as the entrepreneur has stipulated for himself.
                
                Extension
                
                An agreement entered into for a fixed period and which aims at the regular delivery of products (including electricity) or services may not be tacitly extended or renewed for a fixed period.
                
                Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, an agreement entered into for a fixed period and which aims at the regular delivery of daily newspapers, weekly newspapers and magazines may be tacitly extended for a fixed period of up to three months, if the consumer can cancel this extended agreement at the end of the extension with a notice period of no more than one month.
                
                An agreement entered into for a fixed period and which aims at the regular delivery of products or services may only be tacitly extended for an indefinite period if the consumer may cancel at any time with a notice period of no more than one month and a notice period of no more than three months in the event that the agreement aims at the regular, but less than once a month, delivery of daily newspapers, weekly newspapers and magazines.
                
                A contract with a limited duration for the regular delivery of daily, news and weekly newspapers and magazines for the purpose of introduction (trial or introductory subscription) is not tacitly continued and ends automatically after the trial or introductory period.
                
                Duration
                
                If an agreement has a duration of more than one year, the consumer may terminate the agreement at any time after one year with a notice period of no more than one month, unless reasonableness and fairness oppose termination before the end of the agreed duration.

            <p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Article 13 - Payment</p>
            
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Unless otherwise agreed, the amounts owed by the consumer must be paid within 7 working days after the start of the cooling-off period as referred to in Article 6 paragraph 1. In the case of an agreement to provide a service, this period commences after the consumer has received confirmation of the agreement.
                
                The consumer has the duty to report any inaccuracies in the payment details provided or stated to the entrepreneur without delay.
                
                In the event of non-payment by the consumer, the entrepreneur has the right, subject to statutory restrictions, to charge the reasonable costs made known to the consumer in advance.

            <p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Article 14 - Complaints procedure</p>
            
            
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">The entrepreneur has a sufficiently publicised complaints procedure and handles the complaint in accordance with this complaints procedure.
                
                Complaints about the performance of the agreement must be submitted to the entrepreneur fully and clearly described within 2 months after the consumer has discovered the defects.
                
                Complaints submitted to the entrepreneur will be answered within a period of 14 days from the date of receipt. If a complaint requires a foreseeable longer processing time, the entrepreneur will respond within the period of 14 days with a confirmation of receipt and an indication of when the consumer can expect a more detailed answer.
                
                If the complaint cannot be resolved by mutual agreement, a dispute arises that is subject to the dispute resolution procedure.
                
                In the event of complaints, a consumer must first contact the entrepreneur. If the web shop is affiliated with Stichting WebwinkelKeur and in the event of complaints that cannot be resolved by mutual agreement, the consumer must contact Stichting WebwinkelKeur (www.webwinkelkeur.nl), which will mediate free of charge. Check whether this web shop has a current membership via https://www.webwinkelkeur.nl/ledenlijst/. If a solution is still not reached, the consumer has the option to have his complaint handled by the independent disputes committee appointed by Stichting WebwinkelKeur, the decision of which is binding and both the entrepreneur and the consumer agree to this binding decision. Submitting a dispute to this disputes committee involves costs that must be paid by the consumer to the committee in question. It is also possible to register complaints via the European ODR platform (http://ec.europa.eu/odr).
                
                A complaint does not suspend the obligations of the entrepreneur, unless the entrepreneur indicates otherwise in writing.
                
                If a complaint is found to be justified by the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur will, at its discretion, either replace or repair the delivered products free of charge.
